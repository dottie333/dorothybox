This folder is for people interested in real world cases using 
the technical and mathematical side of Data Science, Data Analytics, 
Business Intelligence/ Analytics, and Data Management. 

They are small test cases I have developed to answer corporate problems.   
They are just my way of answering problems.  They are not certified to 
be correct or the most optimized way of answering corporate user cases.
I am only providing this to stimulate your creativity. 

I will continue to add updates. 

This case is based on moving data from an Unstructured 
NOSQL environment into a Structured SQL environment.
