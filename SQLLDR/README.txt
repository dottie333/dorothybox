This is a presentation I made for a job interview.
  
It explains how to use SQL*Loader for a Oracle 12c Enterprise/Standard Edition.
  
If you are already familiar with the Oracle database, you should not have any problems.

Read the Pre-Data-Loading document first.

Then follow up by following the SQL_loader_simplified PowerPoint presentation.
