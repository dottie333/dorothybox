# Healthcare Associated Infection (HAI) measures  

This report provides measures from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  
and the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN).  
It provides information on the infections that patients get while staying in the hospital.  
 
The report is a combination of 3 datasets:

https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Healthcare-Associated-Infections-State/k2ze-bqvw  


https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Healthcare-Associated-Infections-National/yd3s-jyhd  


The National dataset was used as the base for my analysis.  
Note that very few hospitals have reported data.   
This may cause the State Scores and National Scores to change as more hospitals provide measure scores.  

Originally created in Power BI, I will work on publishing in Tableau
