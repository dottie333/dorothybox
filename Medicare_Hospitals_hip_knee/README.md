# Complications and Deaths in Hospital   

Data provided by [Medicare - Complications and Deaths Hosiptals] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Complications-and-Deaths-Hospital/ynj2-r877)  

I have been performing a preliminary analysis on the Medicare provider data on hip/knee complications  
and deaths in hospitals.  

I did not include all the data fields in my analysis.  However they will be included at a later date.   


Please note that For each State the **Count of Provider ID** is the count of **Measure Name** for each Provider ID.  
There is one Provider ID for each hospital 

Attached is a copy of my analyses
