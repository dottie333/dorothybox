#Complications and Deaths in Hospital   

Data provided by [Medicare - Complications and Deaths Hosiptals] (https://data.medicare.gov/Hospital-Compare/Complications-and-Deaths-Hospital/ynj2-r877)  

I have been performing a preliminary analysis on the Medicare provider data on hip/knee complications  
and deaths in hospitals.  

I did not include all the data fields in my analysis.  However they will be included at a later date.   
The fields excluded are as follows:   

-	Compared to National 
-	Denominator 
-	Score 
-	Lower Estimate 
-	Higher Estimate 
-	Footnote  

The above fields are probably going to contain the most valuable information.  They will be addressed in   
the second phase of the analysis. The two date fields are also not addressed in this analysis.   
The two date fields are:  

-	Measure Start Date 
-	Measure End Date 

Measure Start Date has 2 start dates, 04/01/2013 and 07/01/2013. However, Measure End Date has 3  
end dates, 03/31/2016, 06/30/2015, and 06/30/2016. This may or may not be a mistake entered in the  
timeline.  
  
-	03/31/2016  -  4812 records 
-	06/30/2015 - 48120 records 
-	06/30/2016 - 28872 records  

This will also be address in second phases.  

The remaining data is very uniform.  This may be the structure of Medicare. It would be helpful  
to talk with someone that knows the system well.  I am sure we could figure out what else needs  
to be done.  

With the exclusion of the above items, there are 17 providers for each City and 17 measures for each hospital.
