# Worse Reports  
  
These reports show the states and hospitals that scored higher than the national average   
for measure ID for a given time period.   State and national averages do not include  
VHA hospital data.  

Only one measure ID did not have data of the worse count, Measure ID:  PSI_8_POST_HIP:  
Thereby causing only 16 reports to be generated.  The reports will be added until completed.   
I originally created in SQL Server Report Builder 3.0.  However, for better viewing,   
I added the results to excel worksheets.
